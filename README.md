   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Some of the challenges that I faced while building this application involved creating the MoviesAdapter in order to properly display all of the data in their appropriate views.  At one point, I realized that I did not build the constructor properly for the MoviesAdapter since it was missing one of the member variables which was the actual list of movies. Once all the required member variables were passed into the constructor, the MoviesAdapter was able to successfully assist in displaying all of the information regarding the movies.
